## Mod 4 Deliverables:
* Cold Outreach/Networking Deliverable (pick one of these three):
    * Cold Outreach Emails: Link to gist listing overview of 6 Cold Outreach emails following these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cold_outreach_deliverable_guidelines.md):
    * Meetup: Link to gist listing: 
      * Which Meetup you spoke at/will be speaking at and why you chose that Meetup
      * Your talk outline (1-2 paragraphs)
      * 3-4 sentences on how you hope to utilize this talk to help you in your job search
    * Blog Post: Link to gist listing:
       * https://gist.github.com/podoglyph/d0fd7b01fa3d54a486d6838046d07d07
       * When completed, the blog post will serve mainly as a tool to display my interest in Machine Learning. As an intro-style post, it will be followed by more detailed ones and I plan to create a series where it's apparent how much I'm learning. At this point, since I've chosen to go off the Turing-track, by focusing on Python and Machine Learning for my capstone, it's difficult to promote myself in the field I desire to contribute to. So far, my efforts are paying off as I have built an amazingly strong foundation in only 2 weeks.
