# Module 4 Action Plan - Max Glassie
*This is my deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals
* Be hired at a company in Denver, San Francisco, or D.C. - I'm looking for a mission driven organization with a world-class development team; preferably working in Clojure or another functional language.
* Be proficient at JavaScript: basic front-end development and building apps
* Publish a blog post and organize an outreach strategy for sharing it with my network
* Give a talk at the Denver Ruby MeetUp
* Run Armstrong posse.
* Network in Denver, in person
* Build out my mod 3 personal project as an open source project and use it to connect with interesting professionals and have interesting discussions on international issues.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
* Make a spreadsheet tracking companies and potential contacts
* Reach out to my network to set up coffee dates and research both interesting companies, potential contacts, and also strategies for my career development. Outreach 3 times per week at a minimum.
* Follow up with MeetUp organizers and prepare for the talk. Inquire about potentially filming the talk and / or publishing it on LinkedIn.
* Work with my point of contact to ensure that the blog post is useful for their audience, make changes to the draft as specified, and check the content with relevant stakeholders to encourage distribution.
* Bring interesting people together for fun and / or go to a MeetUp a week.
* Update social media presence - mostly Twitter.
* Connect with the Armstrong posse leaders, start learning Solidity / Block Chain on my own.
* Outreach based on my mod 3 personal project, which merges my interest in international relations and web development, to connect and engage in interesting research questions with people in that community.

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
* Spend one hour per week working on Solidity, in order to be more immersed in the block chain technology.
* Continue studying Clojure and reaching out to people based on my interest in LISP.
* Learn JS well enough to do basic front-end and to start building simple apps in Node.*

#### Opportunities Research:
* I'll research using BuiltInColordao, my network, and Turing staff (Meg) to find companies that are aligned with my interest to work in functional programming, to be at a mission driven organization, and to be working with world-class developers.
* My spreadsheet will help  me stay organized and track the outreach I am doing. My online presence will provide a channel for people to engage me and my content.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
* I'll leverage both the Turing network and my college alumni network to find connections and people with whom to have interesting technical and philosophical discussions. I'll use my existing network to build outward.
* Hopefully, my blog post will help me generate some conversation with interesting professionals. I also will make sure to be prepared to connect with people at the Ruby MeetUp, should the opportunity to give that talk come through.
* I hope outreach with my personal project will help me have great discussions with policy friends and make new connections in their community.  

## What I Will Work on with Meg
* How to craft my story, online presence, and personal brand while engaging in outreach efforts. How do I manage and prepare these artifacts so I can engage with people who are interested in my story and not lose those potential connections?
