# Module 4 Action Plan 

## Module 4 Goals
* Be hired or close to hired at a company in Denver, Boulder, Colorado Springs, or NYC. Preferably one of the first three. 
* Have a solid working knowledge of JS
* Have a solid idea of what CS program or greater trajectory I might be interested in. 

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
* Send outreach emails every other day
* Send resumes out every other day
* Use contacts in industry to send out feelers for open positions
* Balance work and job hunting as best as possible. 
* Spend 15 minutes updating my trello board every day
* Bug Turing staff abt CS degrees, reach out to schools and people who have CS degrees.

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
* Pretty confident in RoR right now, continue to add more functionality to RoR knowledge while beating JS into my skull.
* Pushing myself on exercisms and other Ruby sharpening exercises. 

#### Opportunities Research:
* BuiltInColordao, contacts within industry, Turing staff, LinkedIn, etc  to find companies that hold my interest.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
* I'll work to reach out to the alumni network and follow leads from my contacts etc.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
* Finding the right company for me or school to take my skills to the next level. 

## Extra: important to me.
* Really considering going back to school, completing CS requirements to tack on a CS undergrad degree and then going for a masters, +. Think this might be the best way to get a serious role in software development with a much higher upward trajectory and peak. Plus, I don't want to stop learning and Web Development is only scratching the surface of the world of programming that I've discovered. Would definitely like to work for a little while first though before starting to juggle part time school w/full time job.
* It'd be nice if someone at Turing had experience w/getting a CS degree and could point me in the right direction. Will reach out.
