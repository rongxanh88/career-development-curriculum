## Julian Kyer Module 4 Action Plan 

### Module 4 Goals
By the end of module 4, I would like to have a job offer, have a familiarity with back-end engineering, and be comfortable stepping into a junior developer position.

#### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
* Attend 4 meet-ups
* Post projects on GH pages
* Refine LinkedIn and resume
* Talk to Ingrid, Adam, Josh
* Make list of companies in area and research them
* Apply and start interviewing by second week of mod 4

##### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):
In addition to regular projects, keep fundamentals sharp with Iron FE, polish the parts of past projects that I wasn't satisfied with.
##### Opportunities Research:
I will attend meet-ups, talk to friends in the industry, and research online as a "last-resort."
##### Cold Outreach/Network:
I've spoken to my mentor, who said it's better to start early. I also have a couple friends in the industry available as resources, listed above.

I should also talk to the people at the Corner Boxing Club who are participating in FounderFights with me for networking.
##### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
I think my personal brand has a compelling story, and will be helpful to pull on. Being a professional athlete for a decade communicates a lot of valuable things to an employer, as well as my work as an artist.
#### Timeline:
* Start attending meetups, build portfolio now
* Refactor and publish projects over intermission
* Reach out to contacts at end of mod3
* Iron FE and interview prep starting over intermission

##### Weekly Tasks:
* Job search Sundays, Wednesdays
* IronFE 2x week
* Saturday afternoon portfolio work
* Find meet-ups that don't conflict with sparring
#### What I Will Work on with Meg
Finding companies that would be a good fit, how to reach out, resume review.
