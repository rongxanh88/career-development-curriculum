# Craig Ness

## Mod 4 Deliverables:
* Cold Outreach/Networking Deliverable:
    * Blog Post:
       * [Feature Testing with Capybara and Devise: An Open Source Adventure](https://gist.github.com/NessEFC/c2dc6a349bf8419e0dc7c8f9c856ef4c)
       * In this blog post, I document my journey into Open Source Software contributions by describing a problem I encountered while trying to test with RSpec, Capybara, and Devise in an OSS project, and the solution I came up with to solve it. Upon reading it, I hope it will give others clear directions on what to do if they come across this problem themselves. I also hope that potential employers will read it and see that my process for problem solving includes resourcefulness and a willingness to dive into documentation, which is crucial for software developers on the job. I plan on spreading this throughout my network via my personal site, LinkedIn, and possibly via a Medium blog post.
