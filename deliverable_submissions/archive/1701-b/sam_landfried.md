# Sam Landfried

## Mod 4 Deliverables:
* Cold Outreach/Networking Deliverable:
    * Blog Post: 
       * [Getting ID Provider Access Tokens with Auth0](https://gist.github.com/samlandfried/10e63ea1633df6501c0eb7684554ca06)
       * This blog post explains how to use a confusing component of Auth0, a powerful developer's service. In addition to helping people who might encounter difficulties with this technology, I hope that my network will recognize my ability to navigate complex systems. I'm sharing it with my network through my personal site, LinkedIn and Twitter.
