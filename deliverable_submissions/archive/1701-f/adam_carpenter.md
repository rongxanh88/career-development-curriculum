## Name of contact
"The mentor (and alum) I contacted is ___Adam Jensen______"

Date of contact
03/31/2017
He responded and we have been chatting over slack since as he mentors me.
He has given me a lot of insight about the community and how his journey has gone since leaving school as well as mentoring me on different code challenges I have come up against.

* Link to reflection on agile practices/project management used in projects (What project management strategies did you use in your projects this module? What went well? What would you do differently next time?):

This module I tried to use as many agile practices that were suitable, I often ask for feedback and usability then try to implement those change and then ask again for more feedback. I also often like to set a sprint in less time then the project because it almost always takes longer. I also aim for half rather then half-assed if it comes down to that choice and always add features last and functionality first


* Link to reflection on in-person feedback conversation using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

Date of feedback conversation: 3/22/2017

How did you prepare for the conversation? reflected on the past project and considered where both parties were coming from in each instance

How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?
The conversation went well for me, it was easy to talk about a project that has been run recently but it turns out it didn't really accomplish anything as the anonymous adjective' feedback I received from the partner I originally spoke with was very different then this feedback conversation

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? I used the appreciation principle of feedback in my conversation, trying to show how grateful I was to take on that project with that person and learn those challenging things together. I thought it went well but as I said I don't think the adjective feedback with fitting

Any other comments:

* Link to feedback implementation reflection & application of strengths to teams using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_implementation_strengths_reflection.md)


What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? I really enjoy receiving different ideas and explanations from students rather then instructors if something is confusing because if I am confused from the way something is explained then the student who does understand it can probably see where I am coming from.

How do you use your strengths as a team member? I like to work together, side by side through the most difficult programing and save the time consuming css to work on after hours making both members strong when it comes to difficult concepts. I also like to explain concepts that I understand and am patient when doing so and I think that helps make me a stronger team player.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? I would like to continue to develop a greater grasp over concepts and practices as well as become more fluent with vocabulary so communication is clearer.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate? Become better at speaking my mind when I have an idea and develop a grasp of what should be done to make something work properly

How would you like your teammates to see you? A helpful and supportive team member that has a solid understanding but can still learn a lot from other members ideas
