       This blog will be a great talking point with contacts and potential employers.  It demonstrates how I jumped into an unfamiliar codebase in an unfamiliar languange and quickly adapted in order to contribute to the project.  Not only that, but it gave me some experience with Ruby which is a very strong selling point to a lot of companies.
