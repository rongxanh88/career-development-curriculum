## Mod 4 Deliverables:

   - One of my goals is to be a hand up for other Junior developers. I hope this post will help others become more comfortable with contributing to open source projects. It's picked up some retweets and I hope will help expand my network.

* Summary of participation in practice interview and/or actual interview:
  - What happened in the interview/practice?
    - We did this as a class, practicing answering typical questions and whiteboarding
  - What are some best practices of technical interviews that you've discussed?
    - Admit when you don't know something, ask for clarification, give examples from your own experience
  - What did you excel at in the practice?
    - Keeping outwardly calm
  - What will you continue to practice as you prep for interviews in the future?
    - I'll keep going over interview questions and do code wars challenges
