## Mod 2 Deliverables:
I was a project manager in my past jobs and I try to use some of my experience when it came to how I approached projects. I think my head was in the right and I found it was nice to let the team know how we should go at the project in a learning environment. I focused on us working together to solve problems and learn together versus only focusing on finishing the project and grades only. Learning was why we are here and that was what we must do as a team.

I felt like this reflections was something I didn't do prior to my Turing experience. I've learned to stop and think about prespective more and more. I think it has helped me become a more aware professional. Don't get me wrong. I have my bad days still. I let the stress get to me. But I am more open to talk to someone and come up with solutions to try. I'm not sure if the feedback I'm getting is that useful yet only because I feel like people are trying to stay friendly. I would like to hear crtiques with solutions on how be better. I like concrete things I could try. All in all I am learning to be more aware of who I am and who I can be.

"The mentor (or alum) I contacted is Micah Adams"
Date of contact 10/1/16

"01/29/2017"
Outcome (i.e., did you get a response? Yes Did you meet? Yes When? Every week in person or slack/text What was the result? Micah is helping me with all things coding/school)

"He and I have met serval times since I've started at Turing to discuss projects and mind set.

"Micah and I paired over ScreenHero and in person to go over projects.

How do you feel like this relationship will benefit you in your longterm professional development? I will get to work with Micah after I complete Turing.

Feedback II Reflection

Date of feedback conversation: 3/31/17

How did you prepare for the conversation? I thought it through

How did the conversation go for you? It was well recieved. What was easy about the conversation? That my team members were willing to listen to my concerns and needs. What was more difficult? I was worried that they may think I was being combative.

What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation? I used the priciple of we get more done if we work together in this learning environment.

Feedback III Reflection

What are you doing well as a pair programmer and collaborator? I think I am easy to get along with and willing to work together.

How do you use your strengths as a team member? I have been trying to use my communications skills to help bring up any issues we may have as a team and to come up solutions.

How would you like to continue to develop your strengths? I need to speak up earlier.

What would you like to improve on as a teammate? I would like to improve my coding skills and logiical thinking.

How would you like your teammates to see you? As capable.
