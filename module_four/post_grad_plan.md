# Post-Grad Job Search Action Plan Template

*This deliverable needs to be submitted to Meg in order to have post-grad job search support from her.*

The objectives of this plan are to not only help you strategize for your job search after graduation but also to help you plan for your longterm career. After all, your first developer job should align with those goals as well so that you're on track for a longterm successful career. 

Some things to consider:

* What do you envision for your career?
* What do you want your 2nd and 3rd jobs to look like?
* How do you want to be involved with the Turing community? The greater developer community?
* Where do your passions lie?

### How to complete this plan:

Create a gist from this template and fill out the first two parts of this plan:

1. Job Search Plan
2. Longterm Career Plan

The third part is optional although highly encouraged. 

**Note:** If you have already secured a job prior to graduation, skip the first part of this plan and please fill out the second part of this plan. 

## #1: Job Search Plan: Create a schedule & goals
1. Design a 40-hour "work week" that provides time for: 
	* Code (ideally, 2-4 hours a day will be dedicated to coding)
	* Outreach
	* Research 
	* Network   
	* Any other areas where you'd like to grow
How much time will you spend on each? When will you do each thing?
Code: 2 Hours in Morning / 2 Hours after lunch each Day
Outreach: 1 hour each day
Research: 2 hours each day
Networking: 2 event/activities per week + 1 blog post per week


2. Backwards planning: What is your cut-off for ending the job search? When do you want to receive and sign an offer by?
October 30


3. Based on what you outlined above, create monthly, weekly, and daily goals in order to reach your big goal.
Weekly: See above
Monthly: participate in Hackathon, training program, networking.
Work through the frontend program curriculum
Continue practicing Solidity development

4. Block out time on your calendar *now* to adhere to these goals. At the end of each week, assess what worked with the schedule and what didn't so that you can make adjustments as needed and manage your time even more effectively for the following week. 
Done.

5. What "barriers" tend to hold you back in the job search? What steps will you take to overcome those "barriers"?
Cold Outreach and Networking on oneside then having to throw my resum√© into the anonymous pile on the other hand.
Practicing and 'just doing' the first will help me with the second.


## #2: Longterm Career Plan: What are your career goals?
Where do you want to go in your career? 
	
1. Imagine that it's 5 years from now - what have you accomplished during that time? How is your life different? What steps did you take to achieve your goals?
I want to be speaking at tech conferences and developing new tools/languages/systems that are used broadly by the community.  I would like to be working on an app/at a company that has a broad user base where we are having a positive influence on their lives.  I would like to be helping lead a team of dedicated people.

Key to this goal is participating in Open Source, reaching for the stretch goals along the way and keeping focus on what those are so as not to get distracted by what is available and easy.

2. Create a vision statement for these longterm goals.

See above.

3. Reference what you outlined in your Flower Exercise -- what preferred level of responsibility do you want to move to? Do you want to start your own company? What kind of work do you see yourself doing longterm? In your first year on the job, what skills do you want to develop to work towards your longterm goals?
I will be achieving a high level of responsibility in whatever I am doing 5 years from now.  It could be owning my own company again or working for a company that I am an influencial part of. The work I will be doing will be technically challenging and meaningful to its target audience.
