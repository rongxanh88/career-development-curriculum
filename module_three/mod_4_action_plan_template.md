# Template: Module 4 Action Plan 
*This is your deliverable from the [Job Search Strategies I session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/job_search_strategies_i.md)*

## Module 4 Goals

*List your longterm goal(s) of what you want to accomplish by the end of module 4*
-Participate in 5+ interviews.
-Attend over 5 meet-ups and/or conferences.
-Expand my list of industry friends.
-Pick up another language to make myself more marketable, namely Go.

### Strategy To Achieve Goals:
In this section, break down your longterm goal into smaller goals that you want to work on each week and/or day
Participate in over 5 interviews:
-Read & research Ian Douglas' daily interview preparation e-mails.
-Review important chapters from "Cracking the Coding Interview."
-Practice exercises on Hacker Rank & Code Wars.
-Schedule a couple mock interviews.
-Submit resumes/emails to various companies.

Attend over 5 meet-ups or conferences:
-Scour MeetUp, Built In CO & various other websites for interesting meet-ups.
-Purchase tickets to local tech conferences.
-Attend them!

Expand my list of industry friends:
-Attend meet ups and conferences to establish connections
-Meet with mentors, industry buddies, alumni, etc. to chat about the industry, the job search & life in general.
-Keep in contact with existing industry friends.

Pick up another programming language:
-Continue to learn Go on my own
-Take thorough notes
-Start new projects in that language

#### Coding (both including your module 4 curriculum and anything outside of it):

*How will you focus your learning to accomplish your longterm goal?*
-Continue to increase my depth of knowledge with Ruby & Rails.
-Expand my knowledge in JavaScript libraries, frameworks.
-Focus on learning Go.

#### Opportunities Research:
*How will you continue researching companies and contacts? How will you utilize your Trello Board?* 
-I will find companies that are associated with MeetUps.
-I will research companies on Glassdoor, LinkedIn & Stack Overflow.
-I will make notes of companies on my Trello board.
-I will speak with industry friends about local and national companies.
-I will research companies in other areas of the country I'm interested in.

#### Cold Outreach/Network:
*Who will you reach out to? Have you considered talking with alumni about their own networking practices when they started their job search?

-I will reach out to my current, personal network along with established connections I've made through Turing--mentors, alumni, fellows, etc. I have spoken to several alumni about their networking practices and they've been incredibly varied across the board. From speaking at meet-ups, to posting on a job board, to finding connections through other alumni...

#### Personal Branding *(A personal branding section is optional)*:
As a television broadcasting producer for the past 10 years, I've been fortunate enough to obtain a skillset that touches all aspects of the industry from creative to project management to technology. This skillset has been invaluable for deepening my knowledge and solving a wide variety of problems in an effective and efficient manner.


### Timeline:
*What will you do when?*
I am already speaking with alumni, mentors and fellows. I also have a job fair and several meet ups and conferences lined up before mod 4 even begins. I will be preparing for interviews now and during the break.
  
#### Module Tasks:
*What will you do throughout the module?*
I will continue to meet with industry friends and hopefully go on tours of local companies. I will also be applying and hopefully interviewing during this time. I would also like to continue working on personal projects and social media to stand out even more.

#### Weekly Tasks:
*What will you do throughout each week?*
Practice interview questions and technical interview challenges throughout the week. I will also set up coffee meetings and attending meet-ups on a weekly basis.

## What I Will Work on with Meg
*What advice do you need? What would be helpful to talk through? Let Meg know here!*
I would definitely like to know more about how to handle cold outreach or contacting a company I'm interested in working at without having much of a connection and looking too desperate.
