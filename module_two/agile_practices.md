# Agile Practices & Software Collaboration

## Connections: The Why
....

All the things:
* Why...
* Waterfall vs. Agile
  * Intro the manifesto but mention that we'll come back to it later to discuss its merits and flaws -- this will be about students being able to take ownership of their learning in the software industry
  * Turn & Talk: how do you already see agile being used in your processes at Turing? 
* What Agile looks like as a process
* Project Management tools & resources (waffle, XP, Git Workflow, etc.)
* How teams work together (Tuckman's, SCRUM, Honesty, Treating team members as more than just the work they do, Goal Setting, Accountability, Retrospective and review)
  * Bring in readings?
  * Strengths leadership here?
* Discussions:
  * Build own "manifesto" or principles on how teams should work
* Project group break-outs:
  * Discuss strengths leadership domains and what systems you'll put into place
* Final takeaway: how will you continue to apply these days during the rest of your time at Turing? 

Deliverable ideas:
* Describe plan to utilize agile as a process at Turing -- what were you already doing, what did you put into place in M2...
* Reflections on how you're a leader and a teammate, reflecting on your strengths
* Storytelling component (could be part of a different session?): How will you contribute to the betterment of these processes in your future as a dev?

### Objectives (Jeff & Allison)

### Deliverable (Allison)

### Opening (Jeff & Allison)
Discuss the why / provide a hook -- relating to teamwork...

### Waterfall vs. Agile (Jeff)
 
#### Turn & Talk:
* What are benefits/downsides to both Waterfall and Agile?
* How do you see Agile already being used in your processes at Turing?

1-3 groups share out takeaways to the whole group. 

### Agile in Practice (Jeff)
* The Sprint
* Intro to Stories
* Student Practice: Writing a story

### Project Management Tools (Jeff)
* Git Workflow
* Waffle

#### What This Can Look Like at Turing (Jeff)
* Turn your requirements into stories following this template
* Prioritize stories and schedule sprints (even just 2-3 days)
* Deploy to production, maybe solicit feedback from "users"
* Cutting scope is okay, cutting quality isn't

### How Teams Work Together (Allison)
Let's talk now about how teams work together....

#### Turn & Talk

* What has made your previous teams successful? What has made them difficult?
