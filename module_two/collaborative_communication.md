Submit your reflection to your file [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/deliverable_submissions). 

## Opening
Recap project management and agile practices:

* Waterfall vs. Agile
* Tuckman's -- *we're going to dive into Tuckman's as a strategy for approaching teams today*

## Leadership in Teams through Tuckman's Stages of Group Development

### Personal Reflection
Spend 5 minutes reflecting in your notebook on the following questions:

* In the first chapter you read last night, *Ask Questions Instead of Giving Direct Orders*, navy captain D. Michael Abrashoff takes the approach of asking questions of his sailors. Why does he take that approach? What would that look like in a professional software setting?
* What does good leadership look like?
* Look at the slide with the leadership domains from StrengthsFinder and group your top 5 themes into the different domains. Check out [this handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N449kYbcOhu22vbORfjUOfjFOIfPoka5w00q_fklipU/edit?usp=sharing) with more information on what the different domains of leadership mean. What does this tell you about your own leadership style?

Now, you've been forming your own ideas of how you could work within a team. You'll want to have a DTR with your team to discuss this Forming stage more in-depth, but we're going to dive into the Storming page now. 

### Group Discussion: Storming
In your groups, we'll move through the Storming phase of Tuckman's: *"...participants form opinions about the character and integrity of the other participants and feel compelled to voice these opinions if they find someone shirking responsibility or attempting to dominate. Sometimes participants question the actions or decision of the leader as the expedition grows harder..."*

Discuss your reflections and reaction the chapter in small groups:

* What does it mean to be a good leader?
* How can you replicate the questioning approach within teams at Turing?
* What leadership domains are present in your group? How do these domains affect the various roles you and your group might take on? 
* Based on these conclusions, how does your group define the role of the project manager? How are the other team members involved? 
* Create a leadership vision for your team on how you will work together. 

## How to Handle Failure: Norming
Now let's discuss the norming phase: *"Resolved disagreements and personality clashes result in greater intimacy, and a spirit of co-operation emerges."* As a group, discuss the second chapter from the homework, *Mitigate Fault* and these questions:

* What are your takeaways from the chapter? How could this apply to software teams? 
* What does it look like to actually learn from and move past mistakes?
* What would that look like in your team? Set some norms for this using these guiding questions:
	* Acknowledge that failure happens. How can we do that in our team? What will that look like?
	* Encourage dialogue to foster trust. How can you establish honest communication within your team?
	* Separate the person from the failure. How can you create a sense of safety in your team? How will you mitigate fault?
	* Learn from your mistakes. How can you turn a mistake into an opportunity?
	* Create a risk-taking and failure system. How can you make your team a safe place to take risks?

### Scenario Discussion:

	SCENARIO: During your DTR for your project, Teammate A expresses that he/she wants to take on some new 
	features that he/she has never done before. Teammates B and (if applicable) C aren’t sure about this. 
	There is so much to get done, they want to just stick to what they know how to do well. What system can 
	your team create to allow team members to take risks and try out new things in the project? What will 
	your team do if Teammate A “fails”? How will your team communicate?
	
	Now, it's the day before the project is due, and during a group check-in, Teammate A says that 
	they are not done with the feature. What will your team do now?

## Whole Group Debrief
What are your takeaways from today's session?
