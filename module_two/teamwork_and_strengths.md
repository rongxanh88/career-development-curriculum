### Opening

Module Two has been focused on honing your teamwork skills in different ways with an emphasis on communication and feedback. In Feedback III, you reflected on how others see you. Today, you'll build off those reflections to discuss your strengths as team members.

### Individual Reflections
Reflect on how your StrengthsFinder strengths have helped you worked with pairs and teams. 

**Write:** 

* How have you changed since you started at Turing? How have your strengths helped you in that progress?
* How do you feel like you have used your strengths when you've paired with others?
* How could you utilize these strengths more?
* What gets in your way or keeps your from fully using your strengths?
* Reference the [strengths leadership domain hand-out](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N449kYbcOhu22vbORfjUOfjFOIfPoka5w00q_fklipU/edit?usp=sharing) to see which leadership domains you may emphasize the most 

### Pair & Share: Inquiry 
Pair up with a former team member. Describe a few of your strengths to each other.

* Have you seen me express these strengths? If so, how?
* What advice do you have on how I could express this strength more?
* Discuss the [strengths leadership domains](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N449kYbcOhu22vbORfjUOfjFOIfPoka5w00q_fklipU/edit?usp=sharing) on what kinds of leadership you saw most when working with each other

### Agile Review 
Read through the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) again. 

* How does this manifesto describe teamwork to you? 
* What might be missing from this manifesto that could describe a better approach to team projects? How might other perspectives help us understand teamwork better?
* How is this manifesto relevant to the work you've been doing in Mod 2?

### Group Activity 
With your project team members/pair, discuss your approach to the project thus far -- how are each other's strengths being utilized? How do your strengths complement each other? 

Using the [12 principles of Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) as a model, work as a team to come up with a set of inclusive principles to leverage each team member's strengths and how this will positively impact your team for the rest of the project.

### Goal-Setting
Now create some goals for yourself. In your journals, write your answers to the following questions:

* As you finish up Module Two, what do you want to keep doing and what changes would you like to make?
* As you look ahead to Module Three, what do you want to accomplish? How will you do that?
* As you think about your upcoming job search, how will you approach it using what you do best?
